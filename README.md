## BrandPage

A simple landing page built using React.
It includes two components:

- navigation
- hero section.

# Instructions

To run the project, you will need to have Node.js and NPM installed. Once you have those installed, you can run the following commands:

npm install
npm run dev

# Future Work

The landing page is currently not responsive. The next steps involve making it adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience.
